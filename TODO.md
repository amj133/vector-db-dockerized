+ do I need dockerfile to start the app?

+ make into a web app <-- no need right now for POC

+ flesh out docs more

+ what embedding APIs are being used



////////////////////////////////////////////
/////////// WHAT EMBEDDING ALGORITHM?
////////////////////////////////////////////

Looking at your code, you're using sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2.
This is visible in this line from your script:
pythonembedding = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
    model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
)
About this model:
all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is:

A transformer-based sentence embedding model
Based on Microsoft's MiniLM architecture (a distilled version of BERT)
Creates 384-dimensional vector embeddings
Optimized for semantic similarity tasks
Relatively lightweight and fast

How it works:

Takes your text chunks as input
Uses the transformer architecture to understand context and meaning
Outputs a 384-dimensional vector that represents the semantic meaning
Similar meanings produce similar vectors (measured by cosine similarity/distance)

Performance characteristics:

Good balance of speed vs. accuracy
Small model size (~90MB)
Fast inference - good for real-time applications
Multilingual capabilities
Popular choice for semantic search applications

This model is widely used in RAG systems because it provides good semantic understanding while being efficient enough for production use. It's particularly good at understanding the meaning behind questions and matching them to relevant document chunks, even when they use different wording.

/////////// WHAT SEARCH ALGORITHM?

Distance Metrics Available:
pgvector supports three distance functions:

<-> (cosine distance) - default, good for semantic similarity
<#> (negative inner product) - for normalized vectors
<+> (L1/Manhattan distance) - less common
<-> (L2/Euclidean distance) - geometric distance

The cosine distance is ideal for text embeddings because it measures the angle between vectors rather than their magnitude, making it robust to document length differences.
So your system uses transformer-based semantic embeddings with cosine similarity search - a proven combination for semantic search applications.
